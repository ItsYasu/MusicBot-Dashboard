GENERAL INFO

Package.json contains dependendencies and svelte config
prettierignore contains files to ignore by the formatter.

-- ROUTING -- URL Paths that users can access in the browser are defined by files and folders in your codebase
Each folder on routes is a route for the domain.  (in this case for ex: /api/instanplay)

Nested Routing 
Folder inside folder --> for example if we make another foldr inside instantplay folder it would be /api/instantplay/foldername
We have to create +page.svelte file to add the logic of that route

Dynamic Routing (needed for example for a product/id)
We have to make a folder with an specific name [foldername] in our case [productId] or [Id]
